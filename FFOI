    <p>In April 1941, Bose arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected, if equivocal, sympathy for
        India's independence.In November 1941, German funds were used to open a Free India Centre in Berlin, and to set
        up a Free India Radio on which Bose broadcast nightly. A 3,000-strong Free India Legion was recruited from among
        Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps to serve under Bose.Bose's reputation as a politician,
        adversely affected in the previous two years, was refurbished somewhat.</p>

    <P>Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, known popularly as Chandrashekhar Azad (pronunciation (help·info) (23 July 1906 — 27
        February 1931), was an Indian revolutionary who reorganised the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) under its
        new name of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) after the death of its founder, Ram Prasad Bismil,
        and three other prominent party leaders, Roshan Singh, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Ashfaqulla Khan. He hailed from
        Bhavra in Alirajpur State and his parents were Sitaram Tiwari and Jagrani Devi. He often used the pseudonym
        "Balraj" when signing pamphlets issued as the commander in chief of the HSRA.</P>

    <p>Bhagat Singh was an Indian socialist revolutionary whose two acts of dramatic violence against the British in
        India and execution at age 23 made him a folk hero of the Indian independence movement. In December 1928, Bhagat
        Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, fatally shot a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in
        Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British
        police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.</p>
