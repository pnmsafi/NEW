        <p class="ad">  Before introducing the thread concept, we were unable to run more than one task in parallel. It was a drawback, and to remove that drawback, Thread Concept was introduced.</p>
        <p class="sd">
            
            A Thread is a very light-weighted process, or we can say the smallest part of the process that allows a program to operate more efficiently by running multiple tasks simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p class="ad">
            
            In order to perform complicated tasks in the background, we used the Thread concept in Java. All the tasks are executed without affecting the main program. In a program or process, all the threads have their own separate path for execution, so each thread of a process is independent.</p>
            <p class="sd">Another benefit of using <strong>thread</strong> is that if a thread gets an exception or an error at the time of its execution, it doesn't affect the execution of the other threads. All the threads share a common memory and have their own stack, local variables and program counter. When multiple threads are executed in parallel at the same time, this process is known as <strong>Multithreading</a></strong>.</p>
